<h1>NEXLayer</h1>
<p>NEXLayer: Pioneering the next generation of staking protocols using liquiid restaking</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>NEXLayer is a protocol built on conflux that introduces restaking, a new primitive in cryptoeconomic security. This primitive enables the reuse of CFX on the consensus layer. Users that stake CFX natively or with a liquid staking token (LST) can opt-in to NEXLayer smart contracts to restake their CFX or LST and extend cryptoeconomic security to additional applications on the network to earn additional rewards.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li> Clone the repository to your local machine by using following command:</li>
<li>git clone  "https://github.com/AkhileshJyotishi/Nexus.git"</li>
<li> Install dependencies in NEXLayer and Backend using `npm install`.</li>

<li> Start the React frontend using `npm run dev`.</li>
<li>Interact with the dApp on your localhost.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does it works</h2>
<ul>
<li>
NEXLayer, a protocol developed to fortify security and trust within the Conflux ecosystem, operates on a diverse array of participants, with a key emphasis on restakers who contribute shared security via the Conflux network. This collective participation serves as the foundation of the NEXLayer protocol, enabling users to stake their assets within the system. Users have the flexibility to stake both natively staked Conflux and Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) like xCFX,
lxCFX  broadening the range of assets involved in the protocol.
</li>
<li>One of NEXLayer's notable features is its seamless opt-in process, allowing users to engage with multiple security pools simultaneously. By facilitating this process, NEXLayer effectively reduces the barrier to entry for capital and strengthens trust levels across the Conflux network. Users can select from various restaking methods tailored to their preferences, whether it's through native restaking for Conflux or staking LSTs obtained from protocols such as Lido or Rocket Pool. Additionally, NEXLayer supports Actively Validated Services (AVSs), which leverage staked assets to enhance their functionality and contribute to the security of decentralized applications and services within the Conflux ecosystem.
</li>
<li>
    Looking ahead, NEXLayer envisions evolving into a marketplace for decentralized trust, where protocols can acquire pooled security from validators. This strategic integration aims to foster a more robust, unified, and secure blockchain ecosystem by eliminating fragmentation. With a focus on enhancing security infrastructure across Conflux services and sparing stakers from the need to inject additional capital, NEXLayer empowers developers to build secure applications on Conflux while tapping into a vast pool of staked assets and decentralized validator sets provided by the protocol.
